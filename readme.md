# LARAVEL CHALLENGE: THE CALENDAR APP

> The app must:
> - Be implemented in the [Laravel Framework][laravel]
> - Use either mysql, mariadb or SQLite for persistent data
> - Show good versioning control practices (*The commits will be evaluated*)

## PART I: THE BASICS

* Authentication capabilities (sign in, signup, password reset and profile change)
    - Basic profile: email, password, name

For the authenticated user:
* Allow to create an event with the following information:
    - Basic event: title, description, start datetime, end datetime
* Allow to edit/delete his own events
* Show the user events on following lists:
    - Today events
    - Events for the next 5 days
    - All events (paginated)

## PART II: FILES

The user should be able to import and export the events to a CSV, for the same types of events listing developed on Part I.


## PART III: INVITING FRIENDS

The app should allow to invite some friends to the event
- For this requirement your client did not provide much information, so it is
up to you to provide the solution

## FINISHING UP

To finish the app send a Pull Request (PR) to the original repository to the master branch. Do not forget UX matters.
Good Job and Challenge!!
